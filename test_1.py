"""
The program is trying to determine which payment option is better between the two available options.
The first option is $100 per day for 10 days. The second option is $1 a day with the doubling effect each day for 10 days.
The pay rate will be calculated by two functions. The function option1 will calculate the amount for the first option. The
function option2 will calculate the amount for the second option.

The function option1 will print out $100 times 10 days.
The function option2 will loop through 10 times, doubling and adding to the total amount each time.

If the amount is equal, then we print out "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same".
If option 1 is better, then we print out "Option 1 is better".
If option 2 is better, then we print out "Option 2 is better".
